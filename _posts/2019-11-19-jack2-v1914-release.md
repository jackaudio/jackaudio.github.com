A new version of JACK2 has just been released.<br/>
You can grab the latest release source code at
<https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/releases>.

The official changelog is:

- Fix ARM build
- Fix mixed mode build when meta-data is enabled
- Fix blocking DBus device reservation, so it plays nice with others (like PipeWire)
- Use python3 for the waf build scripts

This release is mainly for the mixed mode and DBus device reservation fixes.<br/>
A few distributions need those, and since not everyone is happy taking "random" git commits, a proper release is needed.<br/>
So there you go - a new release. :)
