The jackaudio Website changed its infrastructure from being self-hosted and generated by a script, to being built and hosted by GitHub.

The main reason for this was to easily make the publishing of the static files automatic.
Although it is definitely possible to do this without GitHub, why waste time setting up something that already exists?

This means changes made by a pull-request that get merged into master, will immediately be visible in the website, without anyone having to run scripts or click more buttons.

Note that a fallback solution is in place in case something goes wrong with GitHub (which is basically going back to what we had before).

Also, the way to create posts (like these) has changed. The [README] for the website has more details.
