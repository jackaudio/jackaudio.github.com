Have you ever wanted to take the audio output of one piece of software
and send it to another? How about taking the output of that same program
and send it to two others, then record the result in the first program?
Or maybe you're a programmer who writes real-time audio
and music [applications](/applications) and who is looking for a
cross-platform API that enables not only device sharing but also
inter-application audio routing, and is incredibly easy to learn and
use? If so, JACK may be what you've been looking for.
