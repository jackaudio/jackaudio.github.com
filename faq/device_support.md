# What audio devices are supported by JACK?

## On OS X

All devices with functioning CoreAudio drivers will work with JACK.

## On Linux

All devices [supported by
ALSA](http://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Matrix:Main) (PCI, USB and Bluetooth) or
[FFADO](http://ffado.org/)
(FireWire) will work with JACK.

## On other operating systems

If there is a working audio device driver then it will likely work with JACK.
