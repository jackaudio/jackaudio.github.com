## The Design of JACK

* Paul Davis' JACK presentation, Linux Audio Conference 2003.
  This is probably the most comprehensive overview of JACK's design
  currently available. There are [slides]
  (http://lad.linuxaudio.org/events/2003_zkm/slides/paul_davis-jack/title.html)
  and [audio]
  (http://lad.linuxaudio.org/events/2003_zkm/recordings/paul_davis-jack.ogg)
  available.

  (http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/Oct04/articles/applenotes.htm)
* [Jackdmp](http://lac.zkm.de/2005/proceedings.shtml#letz_et_al)
  a multiprocessor version of JACK. Various publications on Jack on OSX
  as well as Jackdmp are available [here](http://www.grame.fr/publications).

## The Wiki

There is quite a lot of good information on the [JACK wiki]
(http://trac.jackaudio.org/),
although it is not particularly organized.
