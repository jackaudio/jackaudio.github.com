# JACK Documentation

## Using JACK

  * JACK [FAQ](/faq)

## Programming with JACK

  * The JACK API Reference Manual [ [html](/api) | [pdf](http://jackaudio.org/files/refman.pdf) ] 
  * A handy [tutorial/walk-through](http://dis-dot-dat.net/index.cgi?item=/jacktuts/starting/) for programming with JACK, including some simple clients 

## The Design of JACK

  * Paul Davis' JACK presentation, Linux Audio Conference 2003. This is probably the most comprehensive overview of JACK's design currently available. There are [slides](http://lad.linuxaudio.org/events/2003_zkm/slides/paul_davis-jack/title.html) and [audio](http://lad.linuxaudio.org/events/2003_zkm/recordings/paul_davis-jack.ogg) available. 
  * JACK Schematic diagram. Tarball includes dia and eps versions. [ [small](http://jackaudio.org/files/JACK-Diagram-screensize.png) | [large](http://jackaudio.org/files/JACK-Diagram.png) | [tarball](http://jackaudio.org/files/JACK-Diagram.tar.gz) ] 
  * [Porting JACK to OS X](http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/Oct04/articles/applenotes.htm)
  * [Jackdmp](http://lac.zkm.de/2005/proceedings.shtml#letz_et_al) a multiprocessor version of JACK. Various publications on Jack on OSX as well as Jackdmp are available [here](http://www.grame.fr/publications). 

## The Wiki

There is quite a lot of good information on the [JACK
wiki](http://trac.jackaudio.org/),
although it is not particularly organized.
