# Routing GStreamer audio via JACK

Its relatively easy to get audio from GStreamer to flow via JACK:

1. You need the GStreamer JACK audio plugin, which is currently (Fall 2009)
  part of the "bad" plugins collection. Most Linux distributions
  make this available through their normal software install/update systems.
  The name of the package containing this plugin will vary
  from distribution to distribution:
  on Fedora its called "gstreamer-plugins-bad-free-extra",
  on Ubuntu its called "gst-plugins-bad", etc. etc.

2. Next, you need to configure GStreamer to tell it to use this plugin
  for audio output. There are 3 methods available:
  * Through the command line using gconf2 (you may need to install this
    first)
  * Install/run gconf-editor, which is a general purpose utility
    for configuring many GNOME-centric applications.
  * Some systems may have the gstreamer-properties command available,
    which offers a graphical tool for configuring gstreamer.

3. Your goal is set the value of:
  * `/system/gstreamer/0.10/audio/default/musicaudiosink`
  * `/system/gstreamer/0.10/audio/default/audiosink`

to this value: `jackaudiosink buffer-time=2000000`. The exact value of
`buffer-time` doesn't matter too much, but higher values reduce
the chance of glitches/drop-outs in the audio stream. You might also
choose to set `/system/gstreamer/0.10/audio/default/chataudiosink` to
the same value, but its less likely to be useful to you.

The impact of this will vary depending on how much your system uses
GStreamer.  On modern GNOME-based systems, it will effectively divert
all system sounds and all audio playback via JACK. On other systems
(e.g. KDE-based systems) it will have less of an effect, though it will
still impact specific applications that use GStreamer.
